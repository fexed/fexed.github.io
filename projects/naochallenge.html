          <p>
            On May 24th 2015 me and a couple of friends, <b>Simone Tolomei</b>, <b>Klaus Hamiti</b> and <b>Andrea Pellegrinucci</b>, embarked in this fun tournament
            called <b>NAO Challenge</b>. We had a couple of months to prepare for 4 challenges:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h6>Movie Time</h6>The objective was to put on a movie based
                on the users both vocal and visive feedback to a series of
                questions asked by the NAO.<br>
                It was fun and the challenge we won. This was my very first
                experience with <b>Python</b>: a socket communication and JSON
                parsing utility. Written during a one night stand, in the hotel
                the night before the challenge. <i>Fun times</i>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Let's Party</h6>The NAO had to start a party with, at least,
                lights and music. Even better, it should've dance and maybe
                tried to include the users.<br>
                We had a really cool idea, but for many reasons it didn't work
                out well in the end.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Play with me</h6>In this challenge we had to invent a game to play
                with the NAO. We created a number-guessing game: the user thinks
                of a number and the NAO tries to guess it. If the NAO guesses
                right wins, else the users tells the NAO if the number is higher
                or lower of the guessed one. The NAO can try a few times.<br>
                Very simple game, very fun to program it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Sweets Tricks</h6>The goal was to grab two balls positioned at
                random in a NAO-sized shelf, and to put them in a small cart.
                <br>We couldn't debug it very well.
              </li>
            </ul>
            In the end, we won the Database challenge, and got a fairly good
            amount of points in the other challenges as well (given the time
            spent and the problems encountered). Huge shoutout to our NAO bot: <b>Bob</b> <br>
            The prize was a <b>3D printer</b>: the first one I've ever seen and
            still in use in my high school. Altough, <i>I've never printed
            anything With it</i>. If I recall correctly, it is a
